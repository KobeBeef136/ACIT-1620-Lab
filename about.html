        Hi, my name is Kobe Kung. I am 18 years old and recently graduated from
        high school. I attended Templeton Secondary School. I was born in
        Vancouver, British Columbia, and spent my entire life here. I decided to
        take this course because technology has always piqued my interest. I
        currently do not have a concrete idea for my career, but hopefully I
        will be able to figure this out during my time in this CIT program.
      </p>
